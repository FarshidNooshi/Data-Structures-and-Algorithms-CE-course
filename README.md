## Overview
  This repository contains my homework and the final project of the Data structure and algorithms course taught by Prof. Bagheri at the Amirkabir University of Technology.
  It was a privilege for me to have this class with him. We do have 4 homework and 1 final project. all of the solutions and files that have been uploaded here are correct and 
  got full scores from the system tests, you can send me a message if you found a problem or question about the solutions, I'll be happy to respond.

## First Assignment
  basically, the first assignment was for analyzing the running time and complexity of some simple algorithms such as insertion sort. problems being solved by approaches like 
  two-pointers and induction. for the last problem, we compared 10 couple of functions for their order of growth.

## Second Assignment 
  The Second Assignment is the first coding homework that we had in this course. for having the same language for the whole course I used C++ for implementing all of the given 
  coding problems. for the first problem of this assignment I used an exciting approach for using the input streams and also we used stack for solving the first problem, this 
  assignment was mostly for using different data structures because we were taught about them in the previous weeks. the second problem got easy when I used stacks in it, 
  without pre-defined stacks in C++ I should declare a Stack class using other data structures like arrays, this problem was an implementation problem with stack to giving us 
  some ideas of usage of stacks in this kind of problems. The third problem was a little bit more challenging compared to the last two problems because, it needed more code and 
  think, although it was also another implementing problem in my opinion this was the most complex problem of the assignment, It gave me happiness that I solved this problem in 
  a short time like others too. The fourth problem got solved by reversing the vector and it doesn't have more to say. last but not least the fifth problem was an 
  implementation of a doubly directed linked list with several functions.
